I"<p>Building a website from scratch can be challenging. It took me several months of study, practice, tests and neverending headaches to get to this result. The process can be overwhelming (to me it definitely has been): there are tons of different tools, resouces and tutorials; nevertheless, it’s always <strong>so hard</strong> to spend the right amount of time learning something by evaluating its overall usefulness. Since the beginning, I chose to do <strong>everything</strong> by myself: I decided not to use any framework, <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS&lt;/a&gt; or copy and paste any code I couldn’t understand.</abbr></p>

<p>I wanted to learn by doing and do it in the best possible way.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Yep, quite an ambitious purpose. Thus, in the end I decided to take advantage of a Static Site Generator, which doesn’t necessarily make things more complex but for sure it makes them simpler and <strong>way quicker</strong>. We’ll get there.</p>

<p>One last thing before diving in: this article is not intended a guide nor a tutorial. Since I’ve been struggling <strong>a lot</strong> to get here, I feel like it may be useful to someone to know the path I followed (or, better, traced) to obtain what I was aiming at. Not having any clue of the right next step is stessful, I’ve been on the edge of giving up multiple times.</p>

<p>Eventually, another point it’s worth making is that web develpement is <strong>ridicolously cheap</strong>: you just need a laptop (you don’t even need a powerful one), everything else is for <strong>free</strong> (actually, I bought a book, but online there are a few valid alternatives). The only, <strong>huge</strong> price you need to pay is <strong>time</strong>, a handful of restless hours fighting with the urgency and the desire of getting things done, and having paticence following gradual steps.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>I had absolutely no idea where to start. My only notions of programming were some basic concepts of C, which I studied at University. I knew nothing about server management, HTML, CSS, JavaScript or web hosting. My previous website created on Wix with a drag-and-drop GUI to build anything.</p>

<p>So, the first question I asked myself was:</p>

<p><strong>where should I start?</strong></p>

<p>As of when I’m writing, <code class="highlighter-rouge">xplosionmind.tk</code> isn’t completed.</p>
