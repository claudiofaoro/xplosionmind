<p><br /></p>

<p>My name is Tommi.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m an enthusiast, I love getting involved in new stuff and I speak endlessly, definitely too much. I’m an happy guy, but this doesn’t mean I don’t cry (just make me watch any of these movies and I’ll never stop).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When not studying, I do pretty much everything. This means, like Leibnitz said, <em>in my life I started everything and concluded nothing</em> (you got it: a lot of quotes and very little knowledge, that’s me). Among the things I do, you can find the coolest ones (or just the ones I’m most proud of) browsing this website. Speaking of which: sorry if these pages don’t please you or if they’re too messy, I just got started with web programming. If you need a cleaner way to browse: this is <a href="https://xplosionmind.tk">my old soon-to-be-deprecated website</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There’s nothing much else to say, anything you’d want to know you can discover it by reading my crazy blog.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Ok, about the technical stuff you may be looking for to get in touch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>my Linkedin profile</li>
  <li>my Curriculum Vitae (maybe you know it as “resume”. Yep, that thing)</li>
  <li>my email aaaand my public PGP key</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I tweet a lot.</p>
