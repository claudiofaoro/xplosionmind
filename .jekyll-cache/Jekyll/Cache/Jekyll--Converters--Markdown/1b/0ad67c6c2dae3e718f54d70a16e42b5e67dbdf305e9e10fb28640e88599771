I"l<p>There are tools which it would be so useful for me to have but I can’t find the right scripts/programs/apps to accomplish the missing tools’ purposes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a way to restore several old windows sessions of a browser, with all the tabs (not just the last one), some sort of batch reopen.</li>
  <li>RSS / Telegram channel / bloat.io … a unique, universal and simple method to share stuff
    <ul>
      <li>like a RSS feed, but less technical and more social</li>
      <li>like a Telegram channel, but not depending on Telegram (thus, it should be independent from any platform)</li>
      <li>like bloat.io but without having to pay</li>
      <li>probably Mastodon is the closest thing to my idea yet. Still, too technical.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>audio recorder on steroids:
    <ul>
      <li>all of the following features have to be done locally, offline or at least respecting th user’s privacy and anonymity.
        <ul>
          <li>markers</li>
          <li>auto-generated keywords based on markers, if applied</li>
          <li>instantaneous automatic transcryption (some type of prograssive one, which could analyze the few seconds the user just recorded and immediately parse the text, such that if the one who is recording has lost track of the argument can read his last sentences)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
