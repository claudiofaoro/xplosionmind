# who is this ugly guy

<br />

My name is Tommi.

<br />

I'm an enthusiast, I love getting involved in new stuff and I speak endlessly, definitely too much. I'm an happy guy, but this doesn't mean I don't cry (just make me watch any of these movies and I'll never stop).

<br />

When not studying, I do pretty much everything. This means, like Leibnitz said, _in my life I started everything and concluded nothing_ (you got it: a lot of quotes and very little knowledge, that's me). Among the things I do, you can find the coolest ones (or just the ones I'm most proud of) browsing this website. Speaking of which: sorry if these pages don't please you or if they're too messy, I just got started with web programming. If you need a cleaner way to browse: this is [my old soon-to-be-deprecated website](https://xplosionmind.tk).

<br />

There's nothing much else to say, anything you'd want to know you can discover it by reading my crazy blog.

<br />

Ok, about the technical stuff you may be looking for to get in touch:

- my Linkedin profile
- my Curriculum Vitae (maybe you know it as "resume". Yep, that thing)
- my email aaaand my public PGP key

<br />

I tweet a lot.
