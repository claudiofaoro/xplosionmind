One of the first year exams for the <a href="https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.offerta_formativa_2019.vis?p_coorte=2020&p_sdu=37&p_cds=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> degree can be chosen by the student. I chose *Philosophy and Engineering* and this is my blog, which provides the great part of my evaluation.
