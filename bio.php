			<h1>who is this gorgeous guy</h1>
			<p>My name is Tommi.</p>
			<p><br /></p>
			<p>I&#39;m an enthusiast, I love getting involved in new stuff and I speak endlessly, definitely too much. I&#39;m an happy guy, but this doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t cry (just make me watch any of these movies and I&#39;ll never stop).</p>
			<p><br /></p>
			<p>When not studying, I do pretty much everything. This means, like Leibnitz said, <em>in my life I started everything and concluded nothing</em> (you got it: a lot of quotes and very little knowledge, that&#39;s me). Among the things I do, you can find the coolest ones (or just the ones I&#39;m most proud of) browsing this website. Speaking of which: sorry if these pages don&#39;t please you or if they&#39;re too messy, I just got started with web programming. If you need a cleaner way to browse: this is <a href="https://xplosionmind.tk">my old soon-to-be-deprecated website</a>.</p>
			<p><br /></p>
			<p>There&#39;s nothing much else to say, anything you&#39;d want to know you can discover it by reading my crazy blog.</p>
			<p><br /></p>
			<p>Ok, about the technical stuff you may be looking for to get in touch:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>my Linkedin profile</li>
				<li>my Curriculum Vitae (maybe you know it as &quot;resume&quot;. Yep, that thing)</li>
				<li>my email aaaand my public PGP key</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br /></p>
			<p>I tweet a lot.</p>
